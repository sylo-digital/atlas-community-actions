A wrapper for the `a!level` command that adds a new sub-command.  

Auto generates an embed with information about the Role Rewards of the Levels plugin.  

Includes: 
- Total Rewards
- Reward Roles and the Levels asociated with them
- States of: 
	- DM Notifications
	- Stack Rewards
	- Role Sync.

Valid args are `role(s)` or `reward(s)`.  If neither are provided, the command defaults to native `a!level` functionality.
