Have Atlas send a "Sticky Message", a mesage that is always at the bottom of the channel.
At the begining of the action you will see multiple `{=key;value}`. This is were you set the details of the message.

As MessageCreate actions have a 1 minute cooldown for Humans, it is recomended to only use this action in channels with not a lot of activity.

Set the "Message Channel" to the channel you want the Sticky Message to be sent.
