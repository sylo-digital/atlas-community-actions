Have Atlas send a "Sticky Message", a mesage that is always at the bottom of the channel.
At the begining of the action you will see `{set;Message;Your_Message_Here}`. This is were you set the message.

As MessageCreate actions have a 10 second cooldown for Humans, it is recomended to set the Channel Slowmode to 10s.

Set the "Trigger Content" to the channel you want the Sticky Message to be sent.
