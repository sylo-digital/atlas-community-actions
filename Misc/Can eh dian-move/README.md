# Move

Basic move action to move messages from one channel to another

NOTE: DOES NOT MOVE IMAGES/ATTACHMENTS YET AS ATLAS DOES NOT HAVE A TAG FOR THEM

## Usage

1) [import the action](https://github.com/sylo-digital/community-actions#import-actions-from-this-repository-into-your-server)
2) add the proper whitelists/blacklists so only the members that should have access to the command can use it (defaults to require manage message permissions)
3) Use the slash command `/move` in discord and fill in the required options
