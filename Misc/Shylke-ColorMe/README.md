# ColorMe

A command to let your users assign color roles to themselves effortlessly.

**Note:** this action won't let you change the color of an existing role. This is not possible within Atlas itself, and it won't be possible through an action.

## How to Use:
There is a `{set;color;Color1ID|ColorID2|ColorID3}` variable at the top of the command, replace `ColorID` with your color roles' IDs, you can also add more roles by separating the IDs with `|`.

## From the Help Command:

* `a!colorme <color>`ãƒ»gives you the specified color role.

* `a!colorme list`ãƒ»list you the available color roles on this server.
