# Cooldown
Code that allows users to add a cooldown to their actions whether it's a global cooldown or a by-user cooldown. 

To implement this code, all that is required is for you to copy-paste the code into your script and read the 2 {note}'s at the top of the script for info on what to change. Then, replace the {note} near the bottom of the snippet with your action that you want to run when the cooldown is over/inactive.
### Global Cooldown
* Cooldown affects everyone after one user uses the action

### User Cooldown
* Cooldown applies to seperate users after they use the action
